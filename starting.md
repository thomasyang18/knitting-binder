# Starting Knitting

Followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_R1UDsNOMk) for knitting.

As a lefty, I had to actually flip everything around completely. Yes, even the slip-knot; I kept failing and getting a large loop at the end of the first stitch, now I know why.

(In particular, you want the yarn cord, when you start to knit the stitches, to be **under** each stitch.)

I think I bought too big of yarn, size 9.5. I had to stop a piece after maybe 10 rows because it just got too tight and I would keep breaking the yarn. Yarn is both more sturdy and more fragile than I imagined it to be (yes I've played with yarn before in school, but never knitted with it).

Overall? I was hoping it would be a more relaxing activity. I suppose I'm still at the stage where I still have no idea what I'm doing. The hope is that once I make a few pieces it'll become more relaxing.
